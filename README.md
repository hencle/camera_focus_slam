# camera_focus_slam
trying to use object detection in combination of autofocus algorithms to get a sparse slam map. Likely to not work great and fail when objects are moving. 

TODO:
1. finish mtor control and stall guard for sensorless endstop detection
2. object detectrion and centralizing camera to object detection
3. calibrate autofocus and camera/motor setting
4. Try to apply several autofocus algorithms on frame and smaller subframes and compare performance 
5. SLAM
