# camera_focus_slam
trying to use object detection in combination of autofocus algorithms to get a sparse slam map. Likely to not work great and fail when objects are moving. 

TODO:
1. finish mtor control and stall guard for sensorless endstop detection
2. calibrate tmc driver values for better sg performance. compare to MArlin sftware settings to get mroe inside...  
3. object detectrion and centralizing camera to object detection
4. calibrate autofocus and camera/motor setting
5. Try to apply several autofocus algorithms on frame and smaller subframes and compare performance 
6. SLAM
